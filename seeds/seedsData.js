His eldest son George brewed the first Robinsons Ale there in 1849.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Frederic Robinson took over from George and bought a warehouse to the rear of the inn to expand brewing capacity. As a result, Robinsons ale became available at pubs around the Stockport area. To control the quality of ale sold, Frederic began to purchase public houses. From 1878 until his death in 1890, Frederic established twelve pubs which exclusively served his ale. This was the beginning of what was to become an estate of over 300 pubs across the North West of England and North Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Unicorn Brewery still rests on the foundations of the public house on Lower Hillgate in Stockport.[1]\r\n\r\nThe brewery continues to be run by the fifth and sixth generations of the Robinson family. The company took over Hartley's Brewery in Ulverston in 1982, closing it and transferring the brewing of Hartley's beers to Stockport in 1991.[2] Robinsons have acquired a number of other breweries over the years, including John Heginbotham, Stalybridge (1915); T. Schofield & Son, Ashton under Lyne (1926); Kays Atlas Brewery, Ardwick (1929) and Bell & Co, Stockport (1949).[1]\r\n\r\nThe brewery owns many historic pubs, including the New Hall Inn in Bowness on Windermere.",
